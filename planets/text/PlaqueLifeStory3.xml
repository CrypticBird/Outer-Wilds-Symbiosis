			<Page>I met Geswaldo on a wintry night â€” the kind that makes one question bitterly the supposed virtues of warmth or love amid snow and wind.</Page>
			<Page>He approached me at the bar and introduced himself over a glass of saltwater on the rocks. For me, then, he ordered a glass of centipedes.</Page>
			<Page>By the end of the night, I was shocked at his touch. By the end of the month, I was his groom-to-be. I love him.</Page>
