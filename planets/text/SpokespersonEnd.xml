			<Page>Did you enjoy the yarn we spun?</Page>
			<Page>We tailored it to you, to test if your kind endangered us.</Page>
			<Page>Your kind is quite erratic — but, noting the tardiness in your arrival, ultimately feeble.</Page>
			<Page>Our assessment wasn’t all dismal, though; your kind’s virtue lies in its communality — its warmth. This we must grant you.</Page>
			<Page>Your dominant concern was for your missing friends. This was endearing.</Page>
			<Page>Your kind has kindled themselves a hearth indeed! Though snuffed out young in this universe, we hope it imprints upon the next.</Page>
			<Page>Go now: be with your friends.</Page>
