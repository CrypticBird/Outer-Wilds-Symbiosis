			<Page>I was born a long time ago to a single mother. </Page>
			<Page>My father had not eloped with some mistress or left for cigarettes and dairy products â€” no, he was gorily enveloped in my mother's tissues, resulting in my conception (more on this later).</Page>
			<Page>With her, I lived an idyllic childhood until she perished on a desert getaway.</Page>
